# Requirements

A client has hired you to track zoo animals.
For each animal, you must track that their name, species, and all zoos in which they have resided (including zoo name and address).

Determine the database tables necessary to track this information.

Label any relationships between table.


### Data Modeling Notes

`Normalization Guidelines`
- each record primary key
- no fields are repeated
- all fields relate directly to the key data
- each field entry contains a single data point
- there are no redundant entries


###Â Client mock

#####Essentialism

- Login > talk about core **values** in life

- List of 15 values

- Organize the 3 they find most important

- Write a **value justification** (sentence or paragraph) of why it is important

- Boxes with **activities** they do

- **Link** activities with values

- Activities not linked are assigned 'Not Align'

**Resources** *

## Mapping to REST concepts

Recources > Entity > Table

## Workflow

- indentify entities (draw a square)
- indetify relationships
- identify attributes (columns)

## Realtionships

- one to one: not so common
- one to many: this is it!
- many to many: fake (in my mind)

## Mantras

- many to many -> third table
- one to many -> foreign key
- foreign key -> on the 'many' side
- many to many table CAN have extra info
